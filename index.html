        <h5>A strange poem from the internet</h5>
        <br>
        I don't feel like reading words
        <br>
        I'd rather stitch an iceberg
        <br>
        You want a voice underwater
        <br>
        <br>
        Let's keep going on empty
        <br>
        Breaking in style
        <br>
        The means justify an ending
        <br>
        <br>
        Blues whites and lit skys
        <br>
        The summer was on fire
        <br>
        We felt it inside</p>
